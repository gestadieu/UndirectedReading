      <h1>Title here...</h1>

      In my life, there is an emotion, it has bitterness and joy, pain and happiness. And that is regret. 

I once regretted that I didn’t study hard in peacetime and before the exam. I didn’t realise until the exam that I still had a lot of knowledge that should be integrated, but I failed to master it. The problem that needed to be solved was done, but incorrectly, so I decided in the future to be studious and immersed in my studies, but then the ambitions were left behind. 

I once regretted that I didn’t do exercises seriously on weekdays and I didn’t exercise persistently. When I was lying in the hospital bed, I realised that my health was getting worse and worse. So I started to draw up an exercise plan and schedule. But when I left the bed again, being forgetful as always, I had left it for tomorrow. As a result, the half-drawn form was discarded again. 

My regret is very short-lived, it is like a spark across the sky, and the momentary regret disappears without a trace in the universe. My regrets are ridiculous, and sometimes I regret that I made a wrong pronunciation in a chat with my friends, "What a shame!" My regret is more poetic. It will not bring me unhappiness. On the contrary, sometimes the things I regret will even become my good companions in life, the happy fruit when I am alone. My regret is colourful and different. It is a sign of beauty, loveliness and success in my mind. It again gives me new understandings of regret. 

As the saying goes, "There is no medicine for regret." But I don't take it seriously. When you miss a good opportunity, you may regret it, regret your own mistakes, regret your momentary confusion, regret everything. 

But at the same time, have you ever thought about getting back together and creating a second opportunity? Perhaps, just as you regret, chances pass by you, again and again, so you might be immersed in regret forever. Instead of this, it is better to seize the opportunity and make regrets invisible. 

In my understanding, regret and failure are the necessary stages to success. As long as I learn a lesson, regret can motivate me to succeed. It can encourage me to brew an amazing miracle. Regret is an important and indispensable word in my life. It enriches my life and enriches my experience. Every success makes me know more, and every bit of regret makes me achieve something. 

On a chill night, looking at the sky in a daze, thinking about the things I regret. Although sometimes it makes me feel regretful, the breeze that follows blows away my unhappiness and makes me easily welcome the dawn of tomorrow, laughing at the ups and downs of the world. Life is not a smooth road. It is fabricated into a beautiful life from sadness, joy, cheer, pain, and regret… If there is a flat road and a twisty trail spread in front of you at the same time, which one would you choose? It must be the latter, as it has various tastes in life, even if there is regret, it also has its importance!

"Knowhow" contains many regrets that are beyond our reach. A lot of wisdom in handling matters or interpersonal relationships does not have to be met before figuring out a solution.

Youth is precious because it cannot be looked back. To avoid regret, you should understand what you should know in advance. It turns out that every event or interpersonal relationship in life can be mastered through a review. Even a novice can handle it with ease like a veteran. “I knew it, but I failed” is the most critical “knowhow". If you still can't do it, you waste all of the “knowhow".

Moreover, you may not be able to forgive yourself. If you fail to do it because you don’t know, the big deal is learning from the beginning and passing the level successfully next time. On the contrary, if you “know” but fail to do it, you will be in a loop of regret, and you will miss all opportunities.

From "knowing" to "doing" , it is the furthest distance in the world. Most people think that just knowing is enough. This is a kind of arrogance, which will inevitably bring regret. As long as you are willing to accept the figure of "knowing" ultimately when you are young and learn humbly and down-to-earth, you can quickly reach the state of "doing". And develop a natural habit of "doing it" so that the heart will not be bothered by it. In conclusion, don’t regret what you are now because the road is chosen by you. If you want to change your life, start by now.
