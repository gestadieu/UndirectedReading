  "text": "On a chill night, looking at the sky in a daze, thinking about the things I regret. Although sometimes it makes me feel regretful, the breeze that follows blows away my unhappiness, and makes me easily welcome the dawn of tomorrow, laughing at the ups and downs of the world. Life is not a smooth road, it is fabricated into a beautiful life from sadness, joy, cheer, pain, and regretâ€¦ If there is a flat road and a twisty trail spread in front of you at the same time, which one would you choose? It must be the latter, as it has various tastes in life, even if there is regret, it also has its importance!"
