      "text": "On a chill night, looking at the sky in a daze, thinking about the things I regret. Although sometimes it makes me feel regretful, the breeze that follows blows away my unhappiness, and makes me easily welcome the dawn of tomorrow, laughing at the ups and downs of the world. Life is not a smooth road, it is fabricated into a beautiful life from sadness, joy, cheer, pain, and regret… If there is a flat road and a twisty trail spread in front of you at the same time, which one would you choose? It must be the latter, as it has various tastes in life, even if there is regret, it also has its importance!"

After many days, he almost forgets the existence of the box as he is so busy at work. He needs to take care of himself because he has no wife right now. One night the box starts to glow and he opens it. Some photos appear in front of him so he picks them up and stares at them. He cannot believe what he’s seeing. Those pictures are the happiest memories of his life till now and below the pictures, there is a clock"

However, he had no strength to fight against this social trend. When his parents grew older, he had to dig a big hole, and build a house in it. He let his parents live in there secretly, sending all kinds of food and drinks every day"
