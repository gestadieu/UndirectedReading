          <p>This morning Rufus woke up with a large bump on his hand the size of half an orange. At first, he found it strange, “Is it a boil? Or maybe it's swollen.” Before he could make much sense of it his alarm went off.</p>
          <p>“Oh, crap I’m going to be late!”</p>
          <p>Rufus rushed to put his clothes on and brush his teeth, he also took a slice of bread with him before leaving his house. Rufus grabbed his keys, and without him noticing, when he swung his hand to pick up his keys, everything on the counter vanished almost as if nothing existed in that counter in the first place.</p>
          <p>Rufus was walking to the train station sleepily. He scratched his head, and with the motion of his hand going to scratch his head, a bird resting on a railing vanished. Still oblivious to what is happening, he kept walking, and he greeted one of his neighbours as they passed by each other, and as Rufus put his hands down, the pants of the neighbour disappeared, and so did his bicycle, the man fell on the ground on his butt.</p>
          <p>The day went on like this, with Rufus not noticing the things he was doing, making things disappear at work. Finally, he arrived home, and as he went to open his door, his doorknob vanished.</p>
          <p>“Huh. That is strange. What happened? Did someone break-in?”</p>
          <p>Rufus reached out for his keys, but they vanished at the touch of his hand.</p>
          <p>“What happened? What is going on?”</p>
          <p>Rufus got flustered and waved his hand to his left, and it pulled him to the left side. He tried to hold on to the railing, but as soon as his hand touched it, the part of the railing disappeared.</p>
          <p>Rufus collected himself a little bit and sat down.</p>
          <p>“When did this happen? Is it this weird bump on my hand?”</p>
          <p>Rufus noticed a bottle of milk on his neighbours' doorstep and waved at it. The bottle came flying at him, and he caught it with his other hand. Out of curiosity, he touched the bottle with his rough hand, and the bottle vanished. </p>
          <p>“So, my hand erases anything that I touch…”</p>
          <p>Soon Rufus was seen in the air swinging his arm, erasing the space in the air and swishing all over the place until he stopped at the top of a large construction building overseeing the city. The wind rushed over his face, and in the distance, he noticed a woman being robbed.</p>
          <p>“This is so cliche, but I guess it's hero time.”</p>
          <p>Rufus ripped a part off his shirt and poked two holes for his eyes, and made a mask; he swooped down and erased the robber’s shoes, making him fall down and hit his head on the fire hydrant.</p>
          <p>“Thank you so much.” She smiled. </p>
          <p>“Oh, it’s nothing, just your friendly neighbourhood masked man going for a walk,” Rufus replied nervously.</p>
          <p>“How can I repay you? What's your name?”</p>
          <p>“Well, you know me... As you don’t know me... I am the Masked Hand!” Rufus swung away like a superhero mostly. After all, he was getting nervous because he never talked to a girl before in his life.</p>
          <p>“This city is full of freaks” The girl mumbled to herself.</p>
          <p>Now standing on top of the Tokyo tower, Rufus wonders what to do. So, he has this little secret to himself. Does he keep living his humble life, or does he turn into a superhero? He is left with these thoughts in mind as the sun sets, finishing another day in Japan.</p>
