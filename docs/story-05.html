          <p>Family is very close to you. No matter what happens, this will not change.</p>
          <p>Kinship is a special feeling between people who are related by blood. No matter how one will love each other. Poor or rich, no healthy or sick, even good or evil.</p>
          <p>Family needs to care for each other, understand each other's tolerance and understanding; as close relatives, these can cherish and maintain the family.</p>
          <p>Sometimes a family may quarrel, but it doesn't matter. As long as the family exists, that little storm will not hit the family.</p>
          <p>Families are sometimes very helpless, one cannot choose his father and mother, but parents always love their children.</p>
          <p>I walk on the road of growth. The roadside is full of colourful flowers. The head of warm sun is waving golden light, leaving no footprints of birds from the air to the branches. The melodious bird sings to the earth to send a movement. I close my eyes. My mother's love to me is the beauty of all this.</p>
          <p>My mother is the most important person in my life. I have a good mother. With her every day, I grow up happily. I want to say, "thank you, mom. You have brought me to this world. You teach me how to do things and how to learn. When I encounter difficulties, every time, you are the first to help me. You taught me to be honest, to overcome the challenges and to be strong. ‘'</p>
          <p>When I began to learn to walk, my mother held my waist in both hands. In the photo album at home, there was a picture of that. It is also because of this photo that I wake up with my first memory of my childhood. Now I can imagine the warm light shining on my mother at that time. When she released the hand holding my waist and watched me stagger and walk like a model, her face was covered with the brightest smile. One day when I first got into primary school, my mother took my little hand. The sun was very encouraging, the sky was so blue, and those white clouds were so pure. The campus was so beautiful that day, but it meant that I had to be separated from my mother for some time every day. Now, I have grown up and spend a lot of time on campus.</p>
          <p>My mother is a nagging person. Her words are endless. For so many times, I was scared by her battle. I must confess, some comments may disgust certain people. In the face of those endless words, I finally burst out. Suddenly standing up, I turned around, leaving a hint to my mother, “Do not quarrel". But my mother was still nagging, so I turned my face around.</p>
          <p>My mother is a conscientious person. No matter whether the family conditions are good or not, she will look after my health. She is very responsible. Even the iron black cloth socks can be washed white. She is very hardworking. Even if she is busy during the day, she will spare time to clean up the house. She respects the elders very much. No matter how mean they are to her, she has never complained.</p>
          <p>My eyes focussed on my mother's red hands. Father once held these hands and asked, "just wash the clothes with the washing machine. Why must you do it yourself?" Mother shook her head and turned away. After a while, she said, "washing machines are not as good as hand washing after all." To me, she has given up her youth.</p>
          <p>Family love is one of the most beautiful feelings in the world. I am surrounded by strong family love and gradually melted by love.</p>
          <p>One evening, I laid on the bed, and suddenly I coughed fiercely. I couldn't sleep, and my throat hurt like thousands of needles. My mother was awakened by my coughs. She got up, putting on a thin sweater, and rushed over. My mother asked anxiously, "are you ok? "I shook my head, ”don't worry.” But she patted me and said, "I'll sleep with you tonight." she said and lay down beside me.</p>
          <p>In the morning, when I opened my eyes, it was already 6:30 in the evening. I was surprised why my mother didn't call me so late. My mother seemed to understand and said with an apology, "I see you didn't sleep last night. I want you to sleep more. Don't blame me, OK? My mother looks like a child who has done something wrong. I suddenly feel a warm current pouring into my heart.</p>
          <p>In my life, family affection surrounds me tightly. No matter what happens, my family is protecting me. I really want to melt into this wealthy family affection.</p>
