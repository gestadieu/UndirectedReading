          <p>I had the wonderful opportunity to help draw the illustrations for (Un)directed Reading. In order to match the vast array of themes and concepts this novel had, it was quite a task to figure out a style that would work with each story.</p>
          <p>I took inspiration from a range of sources, from childrenâ€™s books illustrations such as ones from Disney to the edgier visuals of mediums such as noir films and graphic novels. The hardest part of creating my illustrations was when I had to draw ones for more conceptual stories - translating an idea or a thought into a dynamic image without repetition, was challenging to say the very least. Oftentimes, stories with these sorts of content had little to no illustrations. Therefore finding references or inspirations was also a challenge.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, it was an absolute joy to read every single one of these stories and explore their visual components. I hope you all have as much fun as I did reading them, and I hope my illustrations bring an even more enjoyable experience.</p>
