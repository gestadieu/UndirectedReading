Although sometimes it makes me feel regretful, the breeze that follows blows away my unhappiness, and makes me easily welcome the dawn of tomorrow, laughing at the ups and downs of the world.

It must be the latter, as it has various tastes in life, even if there is regret, it also has its importance!"}}

From creating a soulful structure of instruments, representing a story, an emotion, to singing words that I could not express through speaking. Music is storytelling, a language that translates your inner self...We don't have to know how to sing or play the instruments to interest in music because it is a tool to help us get through day by day. Some may take it as a form of art. Some take it as a form of therapy. At the end of the day, music can make bridges and build connections with one and another"}}
